Solution :
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
            int pop[] = new int[2051], res = 0;
            for (var l : logs) { //just increment the birth yr and decrement the death yr of each log
                //each death population has been decreased by 1 each birth population has been increased by 1 
                ++pop[l[0]]; //incrmement birth yr
                --pop[l[1]]; //increment death yr
            }
            for (int i = 1950; i < 2050; ++i) { //from 1950 to 2050 just calculate the population by adding the previous yrs i.e accumulation
                pop[i] += pop[i - 1];
                res = pop[i] > pop[res] ? i : res; //storing the maximum population in a variable when found
            }
        return res;
    }
}
