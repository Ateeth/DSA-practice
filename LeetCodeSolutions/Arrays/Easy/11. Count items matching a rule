Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        int ctr = 0 ; 
        int rule = 0 ;
        
        //NOTICE .equals is used not == to compare the string as .equals does not care about where is stored , it returns true or false based on the value of the string only
        //given the order is type (index 0)  , color(index1) ,  name(index2)
        if(ruleKey.equals("type")){
            rule = 0 ; 
        }else if(ruleKey.equals("color")){
            rule = 1 ; 
        }
        if(ruleKey.equals("name")){
            rule = 2 ; 
        }
        
        for(List innerList : items){ //iterate each of the inner list (for each loop)
            if(innerList.get(rule).equals(ruleValue)){ //use innerList.get(rule) i.e the index we need according to ruleKey and compare it with rule value
                ++ctr ; 
            }
        }
        
        return ctr ; 
    }
}
