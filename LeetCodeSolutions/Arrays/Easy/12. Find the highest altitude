Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int[] alt = new int[gain.length + 1] ; 
        int max = 0 ; //start altitude 
        alt[0] = 0 ; //altitude at first is 0
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < gain.length ; ++i){
            alt[i+1] = alt[i] + gain[i] ; //here we will calculate the altitude based on before altitude and the gain value we use alt[i+1] as alt has an extra start element which is 0
            max = Math.max(max,alt[i+1]) ; //get the max altitue comparing max and the current altitude computed
        }
        return max ; 
    }
}
