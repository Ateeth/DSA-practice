Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int H) {
        int l = 1, r = 1000000000; //r is 10^9
        while (l < r) {
            int m = (l + r) / 2, total = 0;
            for (int p : piles){
                total += p/m ; // this is pile value/ mid val i.e m is the assumed speed
                int rem = p % m ; // if any bananas are left in the pile after that hour
                if(rem > 0){ //some bananas are left in the pile so it will take one hour extra and so ++total
                    ++total ; 
                }
            }
            if (total > H) //increase the speed by making start greater than mid
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m; 
        }
        return l; //l will be the minimum speed
    }
}
