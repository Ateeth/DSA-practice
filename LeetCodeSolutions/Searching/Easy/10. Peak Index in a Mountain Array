Solution : 
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int start = 0 , end = arr.length - 1 ; 
        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2 ; 
            if(arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]){ //you have found a peak possibility so reduce the end as the peak if not the current element will lie in the left half of mid
                end = mid ; 
            }else{ //you are still in the first half of the array peak not yet found so the peak will be in the right half of the current mid
                start = mid + 1  ; 
            }
        }
        return start  ;
