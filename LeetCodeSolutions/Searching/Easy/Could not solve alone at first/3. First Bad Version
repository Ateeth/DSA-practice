Solution:
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 0 , end = n ; 
        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end-start) / 2 ; 
            if(isBadVersion(mid)){ //means the first bad is in the left side or the current one as when one is bad all elements to the right are bad
                end = mid ;  
            }else { //means first bad one will be towards right as if it is not bad the left ones will not be bad as given in the question
                start = mid + 1 ; 
            }
        }
        return start ;
